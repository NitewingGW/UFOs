# UFOs

# Project Overview
The purpose of this project was to create a simple way to review UFO data from with-in the archives. The rquirewments consited of creating a webpage that UFO enthusiasts could use to search for UFO sightings. The project utilize java script, html and css.

## Results 
The vistors to the websight are able to view all sightings with-in the archives without taking any additional steps. Filtering was created to accept user input and allow users to search by date, city, state, country and the shape of the UFO. Visitors cvan also search by multiple criteria ex state and shape.

## Summary
Due to the scope of the project there are a few drawbacks with reatgrd to the current design. 
* Default view does not sort but any of the columns. This will make it hard for visitors to search all locations in the order of dates to identify possible patterns.
* States and countries should be listed in a drop down. This would make it easier for users to know what data is available.
* Shapes should be listed as a drop down. Users will be unable to select all options without first reviewing the data. This is currently not an issue but as the archives grow it may become very difficult to find every shape in the holdings
